# Biggie

A simple HTML page to display text or a list of text (separated by lines) 
on a full screen. It makes use of the [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API)
and is poorly implemented in iOS. It works as expected on all other standards
compliant browsers.

## Raison D'Ãªtre

At a time when we need to maintain a distance to prevent contagion, people 
are separated by protective barriers and talking can release droplets we
need to come up with solutions to make it easy to communicate via small
snippets of text.

For example, you go to your neighbourhood store and the storekeeper has
put up a barrier ensuring you are 6 feet away. You can write down your
grocery list and show it to them one by one without having to raise your
voice or violating distancing protocols.

Or you are a person who is behind a kiosk or protective barrier. You can 
communicate with people through this.
